## Summary

The EntraPIM PowerShell module has been successfully developed with the following achievements:

1. **Module Structure**: Created a standard PowerShell module structure with proper organization of public and private functions.
2. **Core Functionality**: Implemented robust functions for managing PIM roles and groups, including activation, deactivation, extension, and approval processing.
3. **User Interface**: Created an interactive menu system with persistent state that allows users to easily manage their PIM assignments.
4. **Integration**: Successfully integrated the approvals functionality into the activation menu for a seamless workflow.
5. **Documentation**: Developed comprehensive documentation including comment-based help, markdown files, and a detailed README.
6. **Packaging**: Prepared the module for distribution with proper manifest metadata and packaging information.

## Next Steps

1. **Testing with Graph API**: Complete thorough testing with actual Microsoft Graph API to ensure all functions work as expected.
2. **Publishing**: Consider publishing the module to the PowerShell Gallery for easier distribution and installation.
3. **Feature Enhancements**: Consider additional features such as scheduled activations, batch processing, or reporting functionality.
4. **Community Feedback**: Gather feedback from users to identify areas for improvement and new features.

This project is now ready for field testing and potential distribution to the broader community.
